##Functional description

(1).Add text to the canvas.

(2).Add shapes to the canvas, such as rectangles, circles and many other autoshapes.

(3).Extract colors from anywhere on the screen (even out of this application).

(4).Flood fill a closed graph with the selected color.

(5).The selected color with its hexadecimal color code.

(6).Import image files onto the canvas.

(7).Export image files to a file.

(8).Tailor a selected image on the canvas.

(9). Single selection and region selection of objects.

(10).Undo and redo steps.

(11).Rotate objects.

(12).Set alpha value of objects for alpha blending.

(13).Create animation for objects. This can be done either in one-step manner or multiple-step manner, as the two selections shown below. In the one-step manner, users can create a movement path from the selected object to any given point on the canvas. In the multiple-step manner, users can pick multiple destination points, and finish with the right mouse button.

(14).Analyze the color component of an image, and generate the color palette and *.aco file.

(15). Color palette in cellular form, which contains colors that appear most frequently.

(16). Color palette in square form, which is a detailed list of all colors extracted according to a provided precision.

(17). The scale plate of the canvas.

(18).The canvas with an animated star shape on it, showing the star’s moving process.

Picture 2 shows the assignment of functions on the mouse. As default, the left mouse button is used for select and drag objects on the canvas, the mouse wheel is used for zoom in and zoom out, and the right mouse button will pop-up a context menu, which contains functions such as cut, copy, paste and delete.

##Benefits

When facing with design tasks, designers often have to create everything from scratch, engage in lots
of unnecessary repeated labor, and dive into every detail whether it deserves or not. These works 
often bring a big burden and cause distractions to them, leading to low efficiency and low-quality outcomes.
My tool helps designers create useful prototypes that can facilitate their work significantly. By dragging and 
dropping shapes, and adding animation to them, designers obtain the descriptive code of these shapes, 
which controls their appearance and behavior directly. The code serves as a template of the design, 
and can be modified freely according to the designers’ wish, thus avoiding typing everything from zero 
and managing the mess of code created by hand.
Moreover the function of color analysis can be very helpful for designers, which will save a lot of time to 
manually choose appropriate colors to determine the basic palette of an existing image, especially when 
they want to draw pictures or render scenes. The generated color palettes can be exported as *.aco file, 
and different palettes can be shared between my tool and other designer apps such as photoshop, simply 
by providing the *.aco file, which is also very convenient.

##About me

My name is PengFei Zhao, and my IRC is 'justalittlenoob'. I'm a second year graduate student from 
Beijing University of Technology, majored in software engineering. My time zone is GMT+8.

I like programming,and I've developed GUI for games with Java, mostly with Swing components. 
I've worked in Microsoft for 7 months, and the job content was to develop Metro apps for Win8. The programming
language was JS and HTML5 mainly, and C# and XAML(WPF framework) sometimes. This experience lets 
me become one of the earliest Metro apps developers in China, which makes me proud. A few month ago, 
I completed an medical assistance system for pregnant women and doctors using Python with the 
open-source frameworks PyBlueZ and PyQt. My level of mathematics is satisfying, given that I've won 
the second prize of China Undergraduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I believe that armed with the 
knowledge and experience, I'll be competent for this project.

I like Processing, and I've made some projects with it. You can find them in the reference below.
